We begin with a config.txt file that is necessary for startup

```
# Configuration Variables To Run

        # path to local organized data objects, organized by 
        # /$localCache$/md5(healthCode)/recordId/
localCache    = "P:/_synapseCacheMonte";  

synapseUser   = 'monte.shaffer@gmail.com'; # change to your credentials
synapsePass   = 'MySuperSecretPassPhrase'; 
synapseCache  = "P:/.synapseCache";                 

synapseProject = "mPower";
synapseTables = c('syn10146552','syn10146553','syn10733842','syn10733835');
synapseVariables = c('demographics','walking.training','walking.testing','walking.supplemental');

synapseListJSON = c("accel_walking_outbound.json.items","deviceMotion_walking_outbound.json.items","pedometer_walking_outbound.json.items","accel_walking_return.json.items","deviceMotion_walking_return.json.items","pedometer_walking_return.json.items","accel_walking_rest.json.items","deviceMotion_walking_rest.json.items");


# data-access requires synapsePackage
  # source('http://depot.sagebase.org/CRAN.R')
  # pkgInstall("synapseClient")
  # library(synapseClient);
```

The system will create a local cache of objects as the data is parsed, evaluated, and so on to extract features.

The Harvest stage consists of the following:
```
harvestJSON(mPower$walking.training,     'syn10146553');
harvestJSON(mPower$walking.testing,      'syn10733842');
harvestJSON(mPower$walking.supplemental, 'syn10733835');
```
The above will download all relevant JSON objects and store in the local folder structure (outside of Synapse Cache).  By default, their is a random flag allowing for randomization of healthCodes so several instances can occur simultaneously.  This took 2-4 days.  The nature of the caching prevents general collisions and allows randomization.

After the data is harvested, an initial `harvestAudit()` needs to be called.  This builds a data object by looping over the 79,000+ records and summarizing the results.  This file gets cached for future loading.

Once the data is harvested and organized, the following code with get you up and running (note: doMC requires multi-core environment).

```
# if we have multiple cores, load them
#library(doMC);
#registerDoMC(cores = 16);

setwd("/data/R_data");

library(synapseClient); 	  # ls("package:synapseClient");
library(mPowerEI);  		    # ls("package:mPowerEI");			
	loadSynapse('config.txt',login=T,synapsePassOverride='PutYourPasswordHere');

	# Synapse Client may have the prediction functions, which I have hacked, 
	# so let's include them to override the base functions
	source("R-manualSynapseInclude.txt");  # relative path to the working directory
		loadSubmitLibraries();

mPower = loadSynapseData();  # loads summary data from syntables
	setup = loadSetup();
	audit = harvestAudit();  
```
	 
We have two independent feature collections that get built.
